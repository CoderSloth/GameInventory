GameInventory
=============

Desktop app to keep track of video games for a collector.

I'm a video game collector, and I have a habit of buying
duplicates because I forget what versions/pieces I already
have in my collection. After feeling dumb for a triple
purchase (oh yes, I did reach that level of silliness)
I decided to make a desktop application to keep track
of my "inventory".

Future updates: Cleaning up the UI, potentially adding
a section for condition (mint labels are better than
ripped cartridges or Sharpie-covered boxes).
